# 0.0.3 - 2020/08/02 - Initial release

* Automatically spawn 5e tiny creatures as TinyTokens
* Support for any game system if the token size is set to 0.5 or lower
* Up to 4 tokens can be moved to the same square, and will arrange themselves to fit
* Currently, moving multiple tokens at once needs a lot of work, so it will just fall back to core for now
