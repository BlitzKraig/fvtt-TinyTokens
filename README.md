## Basic configuration

### For dnd5e or pf2e

Spawn a token from an actor with the creature-size 'tiny'

### For other systems

Set your tokens Image Width & Height to 0.5 or less

- If any other systems have a creature size that works similarly to 5e, where 4 can fit into a single space, let me know and I can add support for it

## Current Limitations

* Hex-grids are not yet supported
* Moving multiple tokens at once is complicated, and not yet supported - This will fall back to core behaviour
